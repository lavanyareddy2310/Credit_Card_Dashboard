# Project Overview:
This project presents a comprehensive Credit Card Financial Report created using Power BI. It aims to provide a detailed analysis of credit card operations on a weekly basis, offering real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends. The dashboard empowers stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively, facilitating informed decision-making processes.

# Insights:

* Credit Card Transaction Report: This page provides a detailed analysis of credit card transactions, including transaction volume, types of transactions (e.g., purchases, cash advances), transaction amounts, and any anomalies or trends observed. Visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts are utilized to present the data effectively.
  
* Credit Card Customer Report: The second page focuses on analyzing customer-related metrics, such as customer demographics (age, gender), spending behavior (average transaction amount, frequency of transactions), credit limits, and any customer-specific insights that can aid in decision-making processes. Visualizations such as demographic distributions, spending patterns, and credit limit distributions are included to provide a comprehensive overview of customer behavior.
